# Entry 3
##### 02/09/25

I spend most of the winter break making sure there is a base for my level and creating the file for the player functions all was created except for the image since it wasn't loading the proper image and that made it just be a black square with the title of the file.
![Level](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richardp6889/sep11-freedom-project/refs/heads/main/images/0925.png)
Overall I have gfinish the first part of the level since the next thing that will follow it will be implementing the physics part for acending and decending the platforms and extending the level. The parts I have done are giving the program the keybinds that are going to be used the attributes that the player will have for the game and that solid parts of the level since those images are working.

### EDP

I couldn't get the image to load for the seperate files that are outside on its seperate compared to those that are being arranged on weltmeister which were easiler to load and to move around the way I wanted. I tried looking on the documentation to see what was causing it but nothing there looked any different than what I have in my file. I tried to use different types of images and rename the ones I'm trying to use but to no avail and I don't know if something outside its file is interferring with why the image is not loading or the main screen failing to load. Finding more information on creating images could better my understanding on if the problem is itself or outside.

### Skills
#### Problem Decomposition
Finding out on how I should work my way to finishing this is was crucial since I could focus more on a single problem at a time instead of doing barely anything for all other aspects of it.
### Attention to Detail
For most of the syntax a period and a comma can change it from right to wrong and in moving things around I made sure to be careful when to add a comma or period and when other punctuation needed to be used.
