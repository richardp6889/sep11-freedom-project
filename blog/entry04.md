From last blog until the writing of this I spent my time working on sprite for the game, a background and figuring out a scale to make sure the sprites could be reused when needed at any point in the level. I found one site that I have made my original sprites on but then I stumbled upon another site that made it possible to keep mutiple sprite and edit them if need so I spent time trying to transfer them and build onto the previous one to expand what it looks like based on actions performed. As of now the tree sprite is a little janky since it clips into the other sprite between them making it look sloppy.

### EDP
The sprite fitting in with one another is a problem since it can't be told apart. Something that contributes to this may be the size of the image since it is bigger than the size I have gave it and needs to be cut down. I first started by using a different image than the tree and it is a different size than the tree when the box to select what is to be selected so I will probably have to change how many pixels the tree and the other character have as to fit in and look good.

### Skills
#### Problem Decomposition
Having to understand how each asset contributes to the full picture of the whole level can show what the problem might be amd therefore give sight to what needs to be looked into.
#### Logical Reasoning
Trying to understand why the sprite don't work well together has to use more knowledge to how image size contribute to how they appear than trying to change it to something different.
