### ImpactJS
For the first week and a half I struggled in getting to work since the documentation said something about having a webserver to run it and I need something with PHP and Apache to make sure it is working. I downloaded the server and did what it said and it still didn't work because I don't think the download did anything and then I when back to the Impactjs getting started part and scrolled down to see if there was other ways of getting it to work and because of this I tried the node_module and followed the steps there it worked until the point where it said to to npm start and see the 8008 host is calling and it didn't so I realized I overcomplicated it when I saw the original impactjs folders and realized it had an html that had two line of linking code to some folders and upon using http-server the result to that html page was impactjs running with the text it works!!. I felt relieved upon seeing it but not having wasted so much time on the other options that didn't work. But the relief was for long since I followed along with a video that was meant to recreate pong.  I couldn't understand how to work on weltmeister since it is supposed to be like a level editor where you add the files to get it working. Weltmesiter doesn't work in any way to create the levels nor can it be interacted with.

### EDP
Nothing can be done with Welmeister. I tried many ways looking up how it can be made to work but all that I tried did nothing to fix it. I checked the console in the weltmeister.html and it said something about an error in one big chunk of text and to be honest I didn't know any of what it meant about it not being able to understand what the problem was I turned to the idea of maybe I need to have a webserver to be able to do anything so I added the one that was used with impactjs to have the editor run that is the server.py file. The same result was produced since none of these options provided the weltmeister to perform its job. Next thing I have in mind to do is to switch to another IDE, find some website that creates a web server to use, or to find some other video for help.


### Skills
#### How to Google
I looked for many solutions to hopefully get the weltmeister to work either finding an outside or internal way to fix this problem and to which none of them worked. They just show ways to optimize and how to use it.
#### Embracing Failure
This is something else that was common in this since many times I felt like giving up and walking away from it to which sometimes I did and came back with a different idea on how to solve it.
