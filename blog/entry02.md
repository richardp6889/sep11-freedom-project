### ImpactJS & weltmeister
For the most part the month was spend trying to have welmeister function properly in the IDE and with guidance from Mr. Mueller had the proper UI show up but struggled with having anything other than the boxes that it is meant to pair with its other features. I tried to use the function of localhost to open the weltmeister to open it on the tool folder but it didn't work so I unzip the impactjs into the sandbox open the weltmeister to see if it would work and it did so what I began doing was adding the files to give the entities function while making sure it doesn't break the weltmeister.

### EDP
I began trying to figure out what to do in the weltmeister.html by myself tinkering with the different buttons and trying to attach a file to the layers since the entites cannot be used, opened or even reacts. So I will find and watch video that show using and the different things that can be done in since the Impactjs website does not have any information and if it links to a video it is low quality and does not explain any of if rather just show how to do it. Using what I will learn I will began creating levels and a way to link them together in some way. If any problems appear during this I will further see what I need to do to fix it.

### Skills
#### How to learn
Given that I have had a packed month I had to make the most of the time I had to work on the freedom project to progress. The most I managed to accomplish was create the files to what the entities seen should do but I have yet to figure out which will be what I will be dedicating my time to as much as I can.
#### Embracing Failure
Not having any of what I have planned has gone my way and having to deal with that on top of other problems that I have to figure out such as why certain elements don't appear.
