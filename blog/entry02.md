### ImpactJS & weltmeister
For the first part I was working with weltmeister to have and create the basis of what a level should look like and reading for other functions I could not get to work or was struggling to understand there was a channel [Aditya](https://www.youtube.com/@fierce10) that reviews what the different parts did and somethings I grasped other things I didn't as much. So I worked mostly on the visual of it and some of the functioning part of it.

### EDP
I began trying to figure out what to do in the weltmeister by tinkering with the different buttons and trying to attach a file to level since that is what allows something to move in and the visual didn't show up. You have to link the level to the main screen when you host it and I have yet to figure that out. I have "put" a character in but I can't tell if it works or not so I will continue to try and get this to work.

### Skills
#### How to learn
Given that I have had a packed month I had to make the most of the time I had to work on the freedom project to progress. The most I managed to accomplish was create the files to what the entities seen should do but I have yet to figure out which will be what I will be dedicating my time to as much as I can.
#### Embracing Failure
Not having any of what I have planned has gone my way and finding a way to deal with it is what most of the process to the creation of a level was like.
