### Inclass presentation
I tried presenting basic ideas that would help people understand the tool and compare it to something to make the idea simpler. I then presented the key features of using impact. Going through the process of creating it and what was the most resourcesful sources of help. Probably more eye contact or louder as I mostly looked at either screen.

### Expo
To the people that came I gave them the computer with the game and they played while I explained how I built it and what was the main problem while creating it. So while they continued playing if they had a question they asked it and if anything else came up that they wanted to know about I answered them.

### EDP
From having to gather what to say during a presentation to the class to sumarizing it to people that came by during the expo was a challenge since it is natural that you'd want to explain everything on how you completed your freedom project. So I gathered the main functions, problems, and anything else short but important. The result is an explanation to the other person that informs them enough and leaves room for questions.

### Skills
#### Problem Decomposition
I have to see what was the most important parts that needed to be said and what could be left out when put side by side. Also how to express ideas clearly as many things could be overcomplicated by an overexplanation of what its function is.
#### Communication
Being able to explain code differently to the judges, or fellow classmate as opposed to people that had no big coding knowledge became somewhat of a barrier as I sometimes underexplained it and other times went to indepth.
