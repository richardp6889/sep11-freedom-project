# Presentation Plan

## Hook
* To those that create a game, What would youy say is the hardest part of game creation? -- share a similar sentiment that transitions

## Product
* GIFS or another way to display the different levels and the idea behind the slip

## Process
* Weltmeister level editor and describe how each button contributes
* kill(); and what is does and how the reloading of levels after dying/switching to another level functions
* struggle was getting it up and running/creating what I wanted it to be

## Conclusion
* https://richardp6889.github.io/sep11-freedom-project/tool/impact/
* Find a way that is comfortable to how you'd want to do it. I found people on youtube that explained it and the documentation provided resources that could be descontructed to learn how it works.


<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"
